1. Add abstract methods, class methods and static methods to UI, GUI, Terminal, Creator, Solver, Simulator, Renderer
2. Add class constants for UI, GUI, Terminal, Creator, Solver, Simulator, Renderer (if relevant)
3. Ensure inheritance and composition for all classes is correct and feasible
4. If Solver should have a child instance of MazeSolver / GraphSolver or if composition is better
5. Same thing for Creator with MazeCreator / GraphCreator


6. Split sorting methods from Terminal class into separate sorting manager class with own file
7. Update Software Object Design diagram to show new class including composition
